 Here are the steps you need to follow:

      ðŸ‘‰First, set up the database. 
      ðŸ‘‰Create a new schema in your preferred database management system (such as MYSQL) and name it "vpms_db".
      ðŸ‘‰Import the "Dump.sql" file into the newly created schema.This file contains the necessary tables and data for the project.

   Download and install Apache Tomcat 9.
      
      Set up the server by following the installation instructions provided with the Apache Tomcat package.

   Next, open your Eclipse IDE 
          
          ðŸ‘‰ navigate to "Import" -> "General" -> "Existing Project from Workspace".
          ðŸ‘‰ Choose the root directory location of the VPMS folder.
          ðŸ‘‰Select the project and import it into your Eclipse workspace.
          ðŸ‘‰After importing the project, go to the directory: "src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib".
